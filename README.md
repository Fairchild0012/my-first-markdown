## About This Repo  
This repository is part of my **GitHub learning journey**.  
It contains different markdown practice files like:  
- `SUPPORT.md`  
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`  
- `ROADMAP.md`  
- `SECURITY.md`  
- and more...  

Each file was created as part of mini-projects to practice real-world GitHub documentation.
